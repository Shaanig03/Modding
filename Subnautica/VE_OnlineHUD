About The New Version:
----------------

- this is the re-written version of the Vanilla Expanded mod, the code has been re-written from scratch and there are changes, bug fixes and new content in this version, the source code is much cleaner 
compared to the previous one and is optimized with the introducing of LODs to buildables and items, object pools for fxs and bullets, multi-language(see lang.json), more config(see config.json) options for customization, 
the mod is also lore friendly with the base game since weapon blueprints were removed due to a event and b4 in the previous version you get turrets by picking up a peeper, but now the turrets are left remnants by the degasi crew 
which you have to scan the fragments by exploring degasi bases

- creatures able to destroy your base and the base attack event is now a separate mod called "Base Attack"

- this new version took around a month to complete, if you wish to support me 4 my work there is a patreon button which you can open
