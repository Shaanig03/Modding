Vanilla Expanded Lore Friendly
----------------

- Note: the separate 'base attack' mod is now being worked at, I know I said its canceled but I was playing Subnautica and just really wanted to experience the base attack, so yea xd

- Note: the mod has been updated to 1.0.1, make sure ur on the latest version to avoid issues

- About The Mod: the code has been re-written from scratch with changes, bug fixes and new content in this version, adds LODs to all buildables, uses object pools for fxs and bullets, 
multi-language support (see lang.json), more config options (see config.json) for customization, the mod is also lore friendly with the game, with the turret weapons you have to scan the fragments in the 
Jellyshroom Cave biome where the Degasi bases are, the turret fragments are remnants left behind by the Degasi crew, this is to make things a bit lore friendly



- Note: this mod took near a month to complete, if u wish to support, there is a button for that >_<
